# Comparison with Related Methods

This document positions the **Top-Down Feasibility Decomposition Model (TDF Model)**
in relation to other commonly used methods and frameworks involved in project analysis,
planning, and risk assessment.

The goal is not to rank methods, but to clarify **conceptual differences**, intended use,
and points of complementarity.

## TDF Model and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into
deliverable-oriented components.

### Key differences

- The WBS focuses on **what must be delivered**, not on feasibility.
- Decomposition in a WBS is typically performed **fully and upfront**.
- The WBS assumes that the project is already feasible and approved.

By contrast, the TDF Model:
- decomposes functions **only when required** to assess feasibility;
- evaluates feasibility **at each level of decomposition**;
- explicitly allows the project itself to be reconsidered or stopped.

The TDF Model therefore operates **before** or **independently from** a WBS.

## TDF Model and Stage-Gate / Phase-Gate Models

Stage-Gate models structure projects into sequential phases separated by decision gates.

### Key differences

- Stage-Gate models evaluate **project readiness**, not functional feasibility.
- Gates are typically applied at the **project level**, not per function.
- Feasibility is often assumed or aggregated into a single decision point.

The TDF Model differs in that:
- feasibility decisions are made **per function**, not per project;
- multiple feasibility phases coexist without replacing previous outcomes;
- termination may occur due to a **single indispensable function** being non-feasible.

The TDF Model provides **distributed gate logic**, rather than centralized gating.

## TDF Model and Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

**Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** assesses the consequences of disruptions to existing
business functions.

### Key differences

- BIA assumes that functions already exist.
- It measures **impact**, not feasibility.
- It is typically used for business continuity and disaster recovery planning.

The TDF Model, instead:
- evaluates whether functions **should exist at all**;
- focuses on **feasibility prior to implementation**;
- supports early project termination.

The two approaches are complementary:
- the TDF Model determines feasibility;
- BIA evaluates criticality and recovery priorities for feasible functions.

## TDF Model and Risk Assessment Frameworks

Risk assessment frameworks identify, classify, and mitigate risks.

### Key differences

- Risk frameworks assume that the project will proceed.
- Risks are managed, not used as decision-stopping criteria.
- Non-feasibility is often treated as a risk rather than a stopping condition.

The TDF Model treats **non-feasibility of indispensable functions** as a decisive outcome,
not as a risk to be mitigated.

---

## TDF Model and Agile or Iterative Approaches

Agile and iterative approaches emphasize incremental delivery and adaptation.

### Key differences

- Agile assumes feasibility and focuses on **delivery under uncertainty**.
- Feasibility issues are often discovered during implementation.
- Termination decisions are usually economic or political, not structural.

The TDF Model operates **before** iterative delivery begins and aims to reduce the
likelihood that fundamental feasibility issues emerge late.

---

## Complementary Use

The TDF Model is not intended to replace existing methods.

Instead, it is designed to:
- precede project planning frameworks;
- complement risk and impact analyses;
- provide a structured feasibility foundation for downstream methods.

Used together, these approaches address **different questions at different stages** of
the project lifecycle.

## Summary Positioning

The TDF Model is best understood as:

- a **pre-project feasibility model**;
- focused on **functional viability**, not delivery;
- complementary to planning, risk, and execution frameworks.

Its primary contribution lies in **making feasibility explicit, progressive, and
decisive**, rather than implicit or deferred.
