# Principles and Rationale

This document explains the **principles** on which the Top-Down Feasibility Decomposition Model (TDF Model) is based, and the **rationale** behind its design choices.

The intent is not to justify the model rhetorically, but to clarify the problems it is designed to address and the trade-offs it makes explicit.

## Anticipation Over Optimization

A foundational principle of the TDF Model is **anticipation**.

The model prioritizes the early identification of structural feasibility issues over late-stage optimization.  
Rather than attempting to optimize solutions before feasibility is established, the TDF Model forces feasibility questions to be addressed **as early as possible**.

This reflects a simple assumption:

> Structural problems are cheaper to address before implementation begins.

The model therefore shifts effort from late corrective action to early analytical clarity.

## Progressive Detail as a Cost-Control Mechanism

A common misconception is that the TDF Model is excessively detailed or costly for feasibility analysis.

In practice, the opposite is true.

The model does not require full decomposition upfront.  
It requires **progressive decomposition**, applied only where feasibility cannot be confidently assessed at the current level.

This means that:
- detail is introduced **only when necessary**;
- unnecessary analysis is avoided;
- effort is concentrated where uncertainty or risk actually exists.

The apparent cost of decomposition is therefore a **controlled and targeted investment**, not an uncontrolled analytical expansion.

## Early Cost Versus Late Cost

The TDF Model is based on the explicit recognition that feasibility costs are unavoidable.

The key decision is **when** they are paid.

The model deliberately favors **early cost**, because:
- early analysis is cheaper than late rework;
- early decisions preserve more alternatives;
- late discoveries reduce available options and increase pressure.

From this perspective, the TDF Model does not increase total cost, but **redistributes it to a less expensive phase of the project lifecycle**.

## Explicit Decision-Making

Another core principle of the TDF Model is the explicit treatment of decisions.

Feasibility outcomes are not implicit or assumed.  
They are:
- recorded;
- classified;
- carried forward across phases.

This prevents common failure patterns such as:
- postponing difficult decisions;
- allowing unresolved feasibility issues to propagate;
- relying on implicit assumptions.

The model intentionally removes ambiguity by forcing decisions to be made with the information available at each phase.

---

## Legitimate Early Termination

In many project environments, early termination is treated as failure.

The TDF Model adopts a different stance.

If an **indispensable function** is not feasible, continuing the project is not considered progress, but escalation of risk.

The model therefore explicitly recognizes early termination as a **valid and rational outcome** of feasibility analysis.

This principle protects organizations from:
- sunk-cost escalation;
- politically motivated continuation;
- late-stage project collapse.

---

## Decision Traceability

The TDF Model preserves the **history of feasibility decisions** across phases.

Each phase adds information without erasing previous outcomes.  
This creates a traceable decision path that explains:
- how conclusions were reached;
- why certain options were excluded;
- at which point critical constraints emerged.

Decision traceability supports accountability, learning, and defensibility of outcomes.

---

## Selectivity Rather Than Universality

The TDF Model is intentionally selective.

It is not designed to be:
- fast for all projects;
- lightweight in all contexts;
- universally applicable.

Instead, it is optimized for situations where:
- complexity is high;
- uncertainty is significant;
- failure would be costly.

Projects that cannot tolerate early analytical rigor are often those most likely to suffer from late-stage surprises.

---

## Summary Principle

The guiding rationale of the TDF Model can be summarized as follows:

> The cost of understanding a project is unavoidable.  
> The TDF Model chooses to pay that cost early, deliberately, and transparently.

By doing so, it reduces the likelihood of costly surprises, uncontrolled scope expansion, and late-stage failure.
