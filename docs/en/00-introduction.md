# Introduction

The **Top-Down Feasibility Decomposition Model (TDF Model)** is a structured method for the **early feasibility analysis** of complex projects.

It is designed to support rational decision-making **before** detailed design, planning, or execution activities begin, especially in contexts where complexity, uncertainty, or risk are significant.

The TDF Model addresses a recurring issue in technical and organizational projects:  
many initiatives fail not because of poor execution, but because their feasibility was never properly assessed at the right level of abstraction.

## Why the TDF Model Exists

In many projects, feasibility analysis is either:
- too superficial, remaining at a high and generic level; or
- too detailed too early, leading to over-engineering and wasted effort.

The TDF Model was created to fill this gap by providing a **progressive, top-down approach** that balances abstraction and detail.

Instead of attempting to assess feasibility all at once, the model:
- starts from high-level functional areas;
- evaluates feasibility at each level;
- introduces further detail **only when necessary**.

This allows critical issues to emerge early, when corrective actions or termination are still viable options.

## What the TDF Model Does

The TDF Model provides a formal structure to:

- decompose a project into **functional units**;
- assess feasibility at multiple levels of detail;
- distinguish between indispensable, optional, and substitutable functions;
- identify **blocking conditions** early in the process;
- preserve a clear record of feasibility decisions across phases.

The model explicitly supports the possibility that a project may need to be reconsidered or stopped if essential requirements are not feasible.

## What the TDF Model Does Not Do

The TDF Model is intentionally limited in scope.

It does **not**:
- manage project execution;
- define implementation solutions;
- estimate costs or schedules;
- replace project management methodologies.

Its purpose is not to optimize delivery, but to determine **whether a project should proceed at all**, and under which conditions.

## When to Use the TDF Model

The TDF Model is particularly suitable for:

- early-stage project evaluation;
- complex or high-risk initiatives;
- system migrations and modernization projects;
- environments with strong technical or organizational constraints;
- situations where early termination must remain a legitimate outcome.

It is less useful for small, low-risk, or purely operational activities where feasibility is already well understood.

## Structure of the Documentation

This repository documents the TDF Model in a structured and modular way.

- The `docs/` directory contains the formal definition of the model and its principles.
- Application Profiles describe how the TDF Model can be applied to specific domains.
- Official PDF releases represent declared, citable versions of the model.

The Markdown documents constitute the **authoritative source** of the content.  
PDF files are derived from them and represent immutable snapshots of specific releases.

## Intended Audience

The TDF Model is intended for:

- technical leads and architects;
- decision-makers involved in complex initiatives;
- analysts responsible for feasibility assessments;
- organizations seeking a structured approach to early project evaluation.

It assumes familiarity with structured thinking and does not aim to simplify complexity beyond what is methodologically justified.
