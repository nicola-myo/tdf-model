# Limitations and Scope

This document defines the **scope boundaries** and **explicit limitations** of the
Top-Down Feasibility Decomposition Model (TDF Model).

Declaring limits is a deliberate design choice.  
The TDF Model does not aim to be universal, but to be **precise in its intended role**.

---

## Defined Scope of the TDF Model

The TDF Model is designed to operate within a **specific and well-defined scope**.

It is intended for:
- early-stage feasibility analysis;
- pre-project or pre-execution decision-making;
- complex initiatives with structural, technical, or organizational constraints;
- contexts where early termination must remain a legitimate outcome.

Within this scope, the model provides structured decomposition, feasibility evaluation,
and explicit decision logic.

---

## Not an Execution Framework

The TDF Model is **not** an execution framework.

It does not:
- manage implementation activities;
- define development workflows;
- support iterative delivery;
- prescribe execution methodologies.

Once feasibility has been established, the TDF Model intentionally **steps aside**.

Execution frameworks such as Agile, Waterfall, or hybrid approaches operate **after**
the questions addressed by the TDF Model have been resolved.

---

## Not a Planning or Estimation Tool

The TDF Model does not perform:
- effort estimation;
- cost calculation;
- scheduling or timeline planning;
- resource allocation.

These activities assume that feasibility has already been established.
The TDF Model deliberately precedes them.

---

## Not Suitable for Ongoing or Exploratory Work

The TDF Model is not well suited for:
- continuous exploratory initiatives;
- open-ended research activities;
- projects already in execution without the possibility of structural revision;
- environments where early termination is not an acceptable outcome.

In such contexts, the model’s emphasis on explicit feasibility decisions may be
counterproductive.

---

## Limited by Available Information

Feasibility assessments in the TDF Model are necessarily constrained by the
information available at each phase.

The model:
- does not eliminate uncertainty;
- does not guarantee correctness;
- does not replace expert judgment.

Instead, it provides a **structured context** in which uncertainty is progressively
reduced and explicitly acknowledged.

---

## Deliberate Termination of the Model’s Role

A defining characteristic of the TDF Model is that it has a **natural stopping point**.

The model is considered complete when:
- all indispensable functions are feasible at an acceptable level of detail;
- remaining uncertainty is explicitly accepted;
- or a blocking condition is identified.

At that point, further application of the TDF Model adds diminishing value.

This is intentional.

---

## Relationship with Execution Methodologies

The TDF Model is designed to **precede**, not replace, execution methodologies.

Used correctly:
- the TDF Model establishes feasibility boundaries;
- execution frameworks operate within those boundaries.

This separation of concerns avoids the misuse of execution methodologies as
feasibility substitutes.

---

## Summary of Limitations

The TDF Model:
- does not execute projects;
- does not optimize delivery;
- does not remove all uncertainty;
- does not apply to every context.

Its strength lies precisely in this focus.

By limiting its scope, the TDF Model remains a **clear, defensible, and effective**
tool for early feasibility decision-making.
